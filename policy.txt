Hospital Ransomware Policy

1. Governance

Establish a Ransomware Response Team (RRT) responsible for cybersecurity oversight.

Assign roles to IT, compliance, legal, and operations personnel for incident management.

Conduct quarterly cybersecurity training for all hospital staff.

Develop a ransomware preparedness playbook.

2. Identification

Perform routine risk assessments to identify vulnerabilities.

Maintain an inventory of all hospital IT assets and data storage locations.

Conduct regular penetration testing and security audits.

3. Protection

Implement multi-factor authentication (MFA) for all remote access.

Enforce strict access control policies using the principle of least privilege.

Maintain encrypted, offline backups of critical hospital data.

Deploy advanced email filtering and endpoint security solutions.

4. Detection

Utilize 24/7 monitoring for suspicious activity.

Implement security information and event management (SIEM) systems.

Conduct continuous log analysis and anomaly detection.

5. Response

Establish a ransomware-specific incident response plan.

Isolate infected systems immediately to prevent lateral movement.

Notify relevant authorities, including the FBI and HHS, in the event of an attack.

Communicate response plans to all hospital stakeholders.

6. Recovery

Restore systems from offline backups to ensure minimal downtime.

Conduct post-incident forensic analysis to determine root causes.

Implement improvements based on lessons learned from incidents.

Regularly test disaster recovery procedures through simulations.

7. Compliance

Ensure all security measures align with HIPAA, HITECH, and NIST CSF standards.

Maintain documentation of security policies and compliance efforts.

Conduct periodic compliance audits and employee training programs.

Conclusion
By implementing this ransomware policy, our hospital will enhance its ability to prevent, detect, and respond to ransomware threats, ensuring the continued safety of patient data and hospital operations.
